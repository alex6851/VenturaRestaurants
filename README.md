Hi this is a demonstration of how to user the Yelp API "Fusion" to get data. 
Then I demonstrate how to access that data from a CLI.

To use it feel free to download my github repo"https://github.com/alex6851/VenturaRestaurants.git" 

Then from the project folder type "./bin/VenturaRestaurants" to execute.
